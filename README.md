# Quake4Doom
Quake 4 SDK integrated with Doom 3

Introduction:
This project is a code integration of the Quake 4 SDK against the Doom 3 GPL codebase. 
This means this includes new engine side features that were in the Quake 4 engine,
and some adjustments to the Quake 4 SDK code.

The game is at visual partity with the original game, with the exception of the particle system which was never open sourced(BSE or Basic Set of Effects).

# Quake4Doom
Quake 4 SDK integrated with Doom 3


This project is a code integration of the Quake 4 SDK against the Doom 3 GPL codebase. 
This means this includes new engine side features that were in the Quake 4 engine,
and some adjustments to the Quake 4 SDK code.

The game is at visual partity with the original game, with the exception of the particle system which was never open sourced(BSE or Basic Set of Effects).

Progression Blocker:
There is a known bug were some doors don't open and have to be noclipped past.
